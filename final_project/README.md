# final project ideas

Pick one of the following projects and notify the professor before thanksgiving of your choice.
You can propose an alterative project. After you pick a project it cannot be changed.
Each project can use either CUDA or MPI. (they are NOT sorted in order of difficulty)

1) Implement an image resizing algorithm
(it should read an image, resize it to a specified size, save the image)

2) Implement Agglomerative Clustering (https://towardsdatascience.com/agglomerative-clustering-and-dendrograms-explained-29fc12b85f23) The program would take a matrix of all to all distances between point i and point j (notice the matrix is symmetrical) and return a dendrogram.

3) Implement a program that reads a list of polygons (where a polygon is a list of coordinates of points) and find sets of two polygons that overlap.

4) Given an implicit equation of the form f(x,y) < 0 which defines a shape. Find numerically the area of the shape by slicing the shape in y and parallezing the solving of f(x,y) == 0 for each fixed slice y.
